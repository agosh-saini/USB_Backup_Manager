# USB Backup Manager

A secure and user-friendly command-line tool for managing backup keys and account credentials with strong encryption.

## Features

- üîê Secure master password protection with Argon2 hashing
- üîë Multi-factor backup key management
- üíæ Encrypted storage of sensitive data
- üìù Account credential management
- üîÑ Backup key rotation and tracking
- üõ°Ô∏è Strong encryption using modern cryptographic standards

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

## PyInstaller Instructions

To create a portable executable that can run from a USB drive:

1. Install PyInstaller:
```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

2. Create the executable:
```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --name USB_Backup_Manager main.py
```

The executable will be created in the `dist` directory. You can copy this executable to your USB drive along with the necessary `config`, `db`, and `keyvault` directories.

For more information about PyInstaller options and advanced usage, visit the [PyInstaller documentation](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/).

## Configuration

The application can be personalized through the `config/settings.json` file. Here's how to customize it:

1. **Encryption Settings**:
   - `master_key_salt`: A 24-character salt used for master key derivation
   - `argon2_time_cost`: Number of iterations (default: 2)
   - `argon2_memory_cost`: Memory usage in KiB (default: 102400)
   - `argon2_parallelism`: Number of parallel threads (default: 8)
   - `argon2_length`: Length of the derived key in bytes (default: 32)

Example configuration:
```json
{
    "master_key_salt": "000000000000000000000000",
    "argon2_time_cost": 2,
    "argon2_memory_cost": 102400,
    "argon2_parallelism": 8,
    "argon2_length": 32
}
```

Note: 
- Always make a backup of your settings.json before modifying it. Without these values, recovery of data is impossible
- The `master_key_salt` should be unique to you
- Increasing `argon2_time_cost` and `argon2_memory_cost` will make the encryption more secure but slower
- These settings affect the security of your encrypted data, so modify them with caution

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/USB_Backup_Manager.git
cd USB_Backup_Manager
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On Unix or MacOS
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Run the program:
```bash
python main.py
```

2. On first run, you'll be prompted to:
   - Create a master password
   - Generate a master key using three backup passwords

3. Available Commands:
   - `-h`: Display help menu
   - `add_account`: Add a new account
   - `add_backup_key`: Add a new backup key
   - `view_backup_key`: View a specific backup key
   - `view_used_key`: View a used key
   - `delete_used_key`: Delete a used key
   - `all_accounts`: List all accounts
   - `all_backup_keys`: List all backup keys
   - `all_used_keys`: List all used keys
   - `update_password`: Update master password
   - `exit`: Exit the program

## Security Features

- Master password is never stored, only its hash
- Backup keys are encrypted using strong encryption
- Multi-factor authentication for master key generation
- Secure storage of sensitive data in encrypted databases
- Password confirmation for critical operations

## Reason For Three Password

The system uses three separate passwords primarily as a practical solution to a common problem: people forget passwords. Here's why this approach makes sense:

1. **Password Recovery**: 
   - If you forget one password, you still have two others as backup
   - This provides a balance between security and usability
   - Reduces the risk of complete data loss due to forgotten passwords

2. **Practical Security**:
   - Allows for sharing access with trusted individuals (e.g., family members or business partners)
   - Each person can be given one password, requiring collaboration for access
   - Useful for business continuity and emergency access scenarios

Remember: While having three passwords helps prevent complete lockout, it's still important to store these passwords securely. Consider using a password manager or secure physical storage for at least one of your backup passwords.
